# mutual-tls-plus-oauth-java-test

## this is a simple test of mtls and oauth
#### test-mtls-server1 has several endpoints, some unprotected, some protected with mtls and some with oauth. The purpose test-mtls-server2 is only to call the mtls protected endpoint. You will have to configure your own oauth provider to test the oauth part.

### Will add more info and process to create certs in the future. 
#### Dont think I need to say this, but the passwords should't be hardcoded. This is just for testing purposes. 

### Any question just message me
### Also sugestions are very much welcomed!
